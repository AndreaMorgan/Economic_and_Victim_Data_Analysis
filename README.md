# Economic_and_Victim_Data_Analysis
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

## This project uses data from the FBI's crime database to analyze homicide trends in the United States.  
All analysis was performed with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy.  
Source data is provided by the [FBI Crime API](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api)

The overall summary of the analysis can be seen in the HOMICIDE PowerPoint Presentation, but some snapshots are below:
