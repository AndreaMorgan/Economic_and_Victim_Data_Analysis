# Economic_and_Victim_Data_Analysis
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

## This project uses data from the FBI's crime database to analyze homicide trends in the United States.  
All analysis was performed with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy.  
Source data is provided by the [FBI Crime API](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api)

The overall summary of the analysis can be seen in the HOMICIDE PowerPoint Presentation, but some snapshots are below:

Using Python, and Pandas we were able to pull data from the API and form into dataframes:

Using Matplotlib and Numpy, charts were created and some had statistical tests included:

Later in the summer of 2019, the FBI updated their Crime Database, and we were able to dive deeper into homicide data.  [Click here to see our next project on Homicide in Tennessee.](https://github.com/AndreaMorgan/Machine_Learning_Homicide)
