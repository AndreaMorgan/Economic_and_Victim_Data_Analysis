Guidelines for chart format:
	If using more than one source of information, cite sources in text at the bottom of the slide
	Use "homicide" in place of "murder"
	Include date(s) in titles 
	Remove US Territories from data


Before Thursday's class:
	Create unformatted slides to include your plots and any bullet points of information you want to share
	Send the slides to Andrea.  She will format everything and make the presentation pretty.


On Thursday: 
	When we meet, we'll review the entire presentation together and decide on the final slidedeck, order of speaking, etc.
	We will also organize our files and folders to follow a consistent naming convention and merge our individual files into the master branch. 


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
	Per Myri, include some kind of statistical analysis in your notebook, even if we do not use the plots in our presentation.
	If you are unable to include actual statistical analysis, include a paragraph that talks about what you could have done and why those statistical methods are 	helpful/necessary.
